# Hyperskill: Car Sharing 
This is a CLI program that uses the H2 Database to simulate the storage of companies and their cars, as well as their rental status to users.
Due to using H2, the DB info disappears each time the program is ran.

## Design Lessons
I certainly learned a lot about using the DAO pattern and compared to previous projects in this collection, this became the most modularized project, containing over 10 java source files.
I found that this made it significantly easier to keep track of the functionality of every class and their methods, as well as making debugging easier.

In addition, the DAO pattern I began learning to utilize in this project allowed me to have the understanding that I could simply change the implementation to work with another DB such as PostgreSQL, which would then persist the information after the program completes its run.
